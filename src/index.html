        <h2>History</h2>
        <p >Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 in Tokyo by the three men, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki and the well-known
           film producer Hayao Miyazaki. The name Studio Ghibli was based on the Arabic name for "hot sahara wind" because the founders
            wanted Studio Ghibli to blow new wind through the anime industry. At the same time Ghibli was also the name of an Italian war
             plane and therefore it also represented Hayao Miyazaki's love for planes and for Italy.Before Miyazaki worked for Ghibli he had 
             already directed a few films like Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro and Future Boy Conan. The first original movie directed by
              Miyazaki was Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind in 1984. Some people argue that it's not a real Ghibli production because the movie
               was released a year earlier than the official formation of Studio Ghibli. The official first Ghibli movie was Laputa: Castle in the 
               Sky. </p>
        <br>
        <p>At this time anime was looked down upon in the film industry and Miyazaki a now influential and respected director was also not highly regarded at this time. Anime wasn't mainstream like it is nowadays in Japan, therefore the number of theaters showing the movies as well as viewers were also limited. Movies that are now regarded as big successes like Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky and even My Neighbor Totoro were not famous at all back then.</p>

        <h2>Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
        <p >Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. Through a career that has spanned five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of anime feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio. Miyazaki has been described as combining elements of Walt Disney, Steven Spielberg and Orson Welles.

          In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films. In November 2014, Miyazaki was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his impact on animation and cinema. He is the second Japanese filmmaker to win this award, after Akira Kurosawa in 1990.
